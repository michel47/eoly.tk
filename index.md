###  Eco Organic Technologies (purple tech)

We have the vision of an humanity collectively participating in the regeneration of our ecosystem,
preserving the bio-diversity to sustain life on earth.

Our Mission is to **make it happened** by enabling global goverance for restorative projects using ledger technologies.

We believe there is no time to waste,
we also believe by maintaining a book about the problem we want to address we
are taking the first step toward the solution.  indeed accounting for the
proper metric will enable to accuratly assess the scale of the problem,
and allow us to define our goal and acceptance criteria for the solution
we seek. We are a team of tech savvy people who see how we can help, we invite every one
to join of effort to stop our destructive behavior accross the globe.


We initially focus on giving us the means to kickstart the solution with a
"green" cryptocurrency that respect life and allow a fair allocation of
resssource to "general interrest" projects that matters most.
