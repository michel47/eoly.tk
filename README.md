## Eco Organic Token (for greener cryptocurrencies)

![no mining](img/nomining.svg)

Bitcoin is the defacto blockchain for "store of value", however it is disastrous in term of wasted energy. however we can't improve what we don't measure... this project will remedy that !

With this project we want to create a ERC1155 token we can attached to "dirty" bitcoin transaction (using an OP_RETURN script)

the attached NFT will document the environment impact (C02 emission) etc. We lock the transaction until we collect proof of carbon-neutrality. during the "locked" period the NFT will be used to funds regenerative actions to offset the initial environmental impact.

The use of an 1155 token will allow fractionalization of the token which greatly improve the liquidity available.
